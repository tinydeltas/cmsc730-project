Six gestures
1. open
2. close
3. cut
4. no
5. switch
6. tap
7. volume up
8. volume down


Each wavfile corresponds to one experiment, where gesture is performed in front of speaker
for 1 sec.
We have performed 15 experiments for each gesture.

So total files are: gestures * number of experiments = 8*15 = 120

Naming convenction: <gesture name>_<experiment number>.wav
For example: open_2.wav means experiment 2 of gesture open
